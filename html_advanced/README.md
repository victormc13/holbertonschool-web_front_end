## 0. Create your first webpage (0-index.html file)
Create your first HTML file `0-index.html` with:

* After the doctype, open and close a `html` tag
* Add the language tag, specify English for ISO language code and add the direction tag (ltr or rtl) on the `html` tag.
* Open your file in your browser (the page should be blank)
